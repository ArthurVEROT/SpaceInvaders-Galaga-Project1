# Space Invaders / Galaga Game

## Description

During my training at Ironhack, I had to realize a video game project. I chose to reproduce [Space Invaders](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), and I added elements [Galaga](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga).

I used the Canvas HTML element to display my game and apply my JavaScript logic. I mainly used classes to organise my code, and each class had its own JS file to respect separation of concerns.

I have classes for :

- Game
- Match
- Spaceship
- AlienArmy
- Alien
- Bullet
- Background

The game is available [here](https://arthurverot.com/SpaceInvaders-Galaga-Project1/).
