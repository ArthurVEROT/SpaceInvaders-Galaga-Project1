# SpaceInvaders-Galaga-Project1

## Description

During my training at Ironhack, I had to realize a video game project. I chose to reproduce [Space Invaders](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), and I added elements of the game [Galaga](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga).

I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, more specifically with the Canvas HTML element. I mainly used class to organise my code, and each class had its own JS file to respect separation of concerns.

I have classes for :

- Game
- Match
- Spaceship
- AlienArmy
- Alien
- Bullet
- Background
