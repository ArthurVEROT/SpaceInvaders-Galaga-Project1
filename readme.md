# Space Invaders / Galaga Game

## Stack

HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## Description

During my training at Ironhack, I had to realize a video game project. I chose to reproduce [Space Invaders](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders), and I added elements of [Galaga](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga).

# GamePlay

Just like in the real Space Invaders, you can move from right to left and shoot.
I added the up and down movement, and I borrowed some aesthetic of Galaga game.

# Technical

I used the Canvas HTML element to display my game and apply my JavaScript logic. I mainly used classes to organise my code, and each class had its own JS file to respect separation of concerns.
I have classes for :

- Game
- Match
- Spaceship
- AlienArmy
- Alien
- Bullet
- Background

# Demo

The game is available [here](https://arthurverot.com/SpaceInvaders-Galaga-Project1/).
